# uri

is a `URI` datatype and parser for Carp.

## Installation

```clojure
(load "git@github.com:carpentry-org/uri@0.0.11")
```

## Usage

To get started, you’ll most probably want to parse a `URI` from a string. To do
so, you use `URI.parse`. This function will return a `URI` datatype for you to
work with, or an error type if the URI string was invalid.

If you have a a URI value the simplest operation is probably converting the URI
back to a string using the `str` interface, which should be idempotent—i.e.
you’ll get the original URI back.

You can also ask the `URI` for its properties, like the scheme, the port, or the
URI parameters.

## Acknowledgements

This datatype and parser was heavily inspired by the one in [the Crystal
standard library](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/blob/master/src/uri.cr).
I cannot thank the people who worked on it enough; they saved me from going
through a lot of pain and suffering!

Have fun!
